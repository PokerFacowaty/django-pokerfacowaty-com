<p class="description-paras">Hi! I'm <span class="highlights">Bartek, 24</span> and the internet mostly knows me as <span class="highlights">PokerFacowaty</span>. I'm generally looking for a stable relationship, potentially FWB and new friends that I share interests with. More on the specifics a bit later. I've highlighted the topics of the paragraphs below, hopefully that makes this wall of text a bit more bearable.</p>
<p class="description-paras">I <span class="highlights">work</span> as a programmer and an automation specialist in two jobs simultaneously (but probably giving up on one soon). I got a new job a year ago and my then corporation didn't really care much about me so I simply didn't leave it. I'm a self-taught programmer, started doing it out of passion, now mostly gathering experience and trying to keep learning. Ideally, I'd like to work in a place I consider mostly ethical (Mozilla...?) or one that treats its employees well at least.</p>
<p class="description-paras">I <span class="highlights">live</span> in Kraków and have - aside from a couple months of a forced break - since 2019. I love the city and I especially like the neighborhood I live in.</p>
<p class="description-paras">I <span class="highlights">studied</span> Swedish Language and Culture at Jagiellonian University for 2 years before eventually dropping out (partly because of remote learning and my lack of motivation coming with it) and have currently no plans to study anything, but probably will pick something up at some point. I'm just not a person who can memorize a phone book because someone told me to - sorry not sorry - and would need to really be into a subject in order to study it, especially when working full time. On the bright side, the two years were not completely lost, I still remember some <span class="highlights">Svenska</span>, though not as much as my employer thinks I do.</p>

<p class="description-paras">My <span class="highlights">biggest passion</span> is definitely speedrunning (finishing games as fast as possible) and organising charity speedrunning events. I've recently made my dream of <a href="https://youtu.be/-evoqJa5TVI?si=1vWUlg-zO4uATgdA" target="_blank">running at a Games Done Quick event</a> come true. For 3,5 years I've been the CEO of a Foundation - GSPS - and over 6 years we've raised over 300k PLN during a number of events that gathered community members from the entire country and beyond. I'm taking a kind of a break from the organising world, but in my time I volunteered and helped organize a couple more events.</p>
<p class="description-paras">I'm into <span class="highlights">programming</span>, it started with just an interest for simple scripts in Python almost 2 years ago and I've been learning new things related to Computer Science ever since. I honestly expected I would give up pretty quickly, but it is still something I'm very passionate about. Pretty much every new thing I discover in this subject is interesting and I will gladly ramble about it as long as someone wants to listen (please do). Explaining bits of technology I started to understand in simple terms is also something I like to do frequently for friends and family. A subject related to programming that I've been exploring for years at this point is self-hosting - I like to play around with my server and use services I provide for just myself and friends, like media servers, note taking apps and similar.</p>
<p class="description-paras"><span class="highlights">My other interests</span> involve old technology (like my VHS cam that I ocassionally vlog with, casettes, vinyl, old games and consoles, I also have a TV that's the size of a small house), skating and patiently watching crypto collapse. I read way more than the average (but would like to more), it's usually three books at a time (one fiction, one non-fiction and one technical and I just choose whatever I feel like reading at the time with reading a weekly newspaper somewhere in between - any fellow Polityka readers?). With fiction, I mostly want to catch up with classics I have heard about but never read, reading Goethe's "Faust" now. In terms of non-fiction, it's pretty much any book that sounds like a subject I might be interested in (last one was "The Macho Paradox").</p>

<p class="description-paras">In terms of <span class="highlights">personality</span> I am an introvert, but it might not be very obvious when I'm around people I feel comfortable with. My introvert side is more manifested when I need a day spent in my room without talking to anyone after a week-long event or feeling happy just staying home and doing "nothing". I would say I am not a person to go clubbing with, but actually <s>I would like to find a place that'd convince me there are clubs differing from the mainstream picture of music so loud you can't hear shit and cocaine in the bathroom. If you know any, it could be a date. As long as you're comfortable with the possibility of leaving early.</s> UPDATE: I went to an early 2000's techno party in Kraków in the summer of 2023 and it was <i>amazing</i>, but mostly due to the music and atmosphere. Still open to checking out non-scary clubs if you have them.</p>

<p class="description-paras">I <span class="highlights">value</span> (random order) being fair and sticking to the rules. I'm not a saint, but I want to try and be fair whenever possible, even though that's sometimes seen as me being naive and not knowing the rules of the "real life". I disagree with people a lot over this and it is a hot take, but I have a feeling Eastern European upbringing makes you think cheating your way up to the top is smart and I hate that. All of this sounds a bit extreme reading it back, so to counter it a bit - I cheat at times, obviously. I've cheated in quizzes at uni during covid because it was possible and I couldn't resist. I do not work 8 hours a day every day. The thing that really pisses me off is cheating as a lifestyle and dumb cheating. As far as honesty goes, I really want to be open in communication instead of playing mind games, especially with someone I share my life with. Whether I said something mean without realizing or the sex the day before was horrible, I'd rather know all about it and want to know I can bring up issues I have like this as well. Politics-wise, I'm leaning left, but hate places like Leftbook focused on wars between leftists and leftists with deep passion. I <i>tend</i> to try and see systemic issues and see poor people as victims rather than people at fault, I guess you could say I'm at least trying to be compassionate. I can generally say I'm alright with people having different opinions than mine, we can disagree and still be friends, unless the ""opinions"" come with a strong taste of misogyny, contempt or xenophobia, because if they do, then fuck you and your "no more mr nice guy", he was never there. Stability is something that's crucial to me. I like routines, knowing what I will be doing the next day. Spedning 4 weekends somewhere else than home in a row is just not a sustainable lifestyle for me, I need some time for doing "nothing" at home regularly. Half my life I've been told by random media that it's boring and terrible and only now discovering that this is what I enjoy a lot and it's totally fine for me to do so.</p>

<p class="description-paras">When asking about <span class="highlights">music</span>, nobody likes hearing "oh I just listen to everything"  so I'll at least <i>try</i> to elaborate a bit more. My music involves a spectrum of genres from metal to Ekwador Manieczki Urodziny Brutka 01.02.2003 r. I rarely use Spotify, so whenever I finally make a system for showing my library and playlists on this site, the link will be here (not finished, but some of them are <a href="/playlists/">here</a>). Examples would include pretty much all of the soundtrack for GTA, Tony Hawk and Need for Speed games, Rock classics (like Asia, Dire Straits), 80's Pop, stuff that I considered cringy at 16 years old that actually slaps (like early 2010's Rihanna or Black Eyed Peas), old Polish Rap (Łona, Grammatik, Smarki). At one point I digged into dream house (which led me to discover the beauty that is <a class="links" href="https://youtu.be/p_TkwNLJn68" target="_blank">Sirens of the Sea</a> for example) and similar genres. This led me also like and seek "harder", more rhytmic electronic and trance music like <a class="links" href="https://youtu.be/R2hlXiwe4Aw" target="_blank">Twice in a Blue Moon</a>.</p>

<p id="dates-header">Date ideas:</p>
<div class="dates">
<ul>
    <li>Watching Dirty Dancing together (but it has to be at your place, my TV is placed where two walls meet and nobody puts Baby in the corner)</li>
    <li>1970-01-01T00:00:00Z</li>
    <li>Taking a walk in a place not crowded enough for it to be an issue but also not empty so we're both safe on April the 25th, because it's not too hot and not too cold. All you need is a light jacket.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="description-paras">If you haven't figured out by now, I have a special <span class="highlights">sense of humour</span>, I love jokes that are generally considered awful, especially when they involve translating something word-by-word to make monsters (like "take yourself behind state that" being "weź się zastanów") or wordpuns. <a class="links" href="https://twitter.com/PunHubOnline" target="_blank">PunHub</a> is one of the best Twitter accounts in existence.</p>
<p class="description-paras">When it comes to <span class="highlights">preferences</span>, I would like to meet a person that mostly shares my values and accepts me with my little quirks and hobbies and such. I like to talk a lot about things I find interesting or ones that I recently learned about, but it is a two-way communication - I am always open to talk about what find interesting or what you're passionate about. I'm also a factory of silly little inside jokes once I'm close with someone, so hopefully you have a similar sense of humour. In terms of looks, I'm open to pretty much all body types, but I need to admit, <i>if you're a large woman, I am largely interested.</i></p>

<p class="description-paras">On a similar note - my <span class="highlights">sexuality / gender identity</span> (and I'm sorry in advance if I'm being too honest about this, but I would love for this part to be clear) - I am a dude that's mostly straight. I'm attracted to cis women, trans women, generally feminine people. <s>My only issue is I don't know if penises are a hard nope as I haven't tried yet.</s> Penises on girls are alright ;) In terms of sex, I'm a little kinky (total switch), but don't worry if you're vanilla, let's talk! I have a kinklist and I'll gladly share it, just not here. When it comes to being exclusive, I'm monogamous in relationships. When first dating and seeing how we feel, I'm open to both monogamy and keeping options open. I also think sex and masturbation aren't mutually exclusive - I'm good with you masturbating, watching your porn (I'd even love you to show me stuff you're into!) and vice versa for me. I've been wearing skirts in the summer for a couple years now and recently, I've been trying to explore more non-binary/feminine clothes.</p>
<p class="description-paras">If you survived through all this, I'm flattered, thank you :)</p>
